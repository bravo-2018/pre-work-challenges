# Get Ready For An Awesome Adventure!

You start bootcamp soon! We at Learn are getting really excited for you to start, and we hope you are too. We have lots of great stuff planned, so we put together this list of things you can do to be ready for day 1:

### 1. Create a github account

If you don't have one already, sign up for a github account! Git is an awesome technology that allows you to save and share your progress as you write code, colloborate with other developers on a project, and organize your progress on a project. Github is the online platform we will use to interact with Git. 

If you want to learn a bit more about git, try this free online course: https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git

Once you've completed it -- share it with your future classmates! Post in your Learn class slack channel that you completed the git challenge. 


### 2. Start With the Basics

We want to use your time in class as efficiently as possible, so we expect that you know the basics of HTML and CSS when you start the class. To get ramped up on these two essential web technologies quickly, sign up for a codecademy account and try some of the HTML classes, they are short, fun, and a great way to prepare for the class.

Some of you might be thinking, "there's so much out there, how much do I need to know?" - and that's a great question. Here is a general list of HTML and CSS topics to know:

- What are HTML and CSS for?
- How do you create an HTML page?
- HTML - what are the body and head tags for?
- How do you recognize an HTML self closing tag? 
- Pay attention to how to indent your code to keep it neat and tidy.
- How do you create a comment in HTML?
- What are the tags h1 - h6 for? 
- HTML block level vs inline elements, can you explain the difference?
- CSS - how do you use class and id?
- CSS - play around with the basic selectors
- How do you connect an HTML and CSS sheet?


### 3. CREATE A WEBPAGE!

Now that you've had the chance to get familiar with git and had some HTML and CSS under your fingers, try them out! 

THE CHALLENGE:

STEP 1. 
With HTML and CSS, build a webpage that could serve as your single page profile website. 

STEP 2:
Use your admin powers on this repo - create a new repository, name it ["your name" + profile] and push the code you write to it so we can all ooh and ah over your masterful creation. 

Thought Starters:
You could put up a picture of you, a paragraph about why you want to learn code, a list of past work experience or your crazy hobbies or pets. Really - you can do what you want with your profile page. If you are having trouble figuring out how you want the page to look, draw the layout on paper first, or take a look on theme forest or any websites you like, and try to reproduce what they've done. There's ton's of inspiration out there!
