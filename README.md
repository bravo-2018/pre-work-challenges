# Get Ready For an Awesome Adventure!

You start bootcamp soon! We at Learn are getting really excited for you to start, and we hope you are too. We have lots of great stuff planned, so we put together this list of things you can do to be ready for day 1:

### 1. Create a github account.

If you don't have one already, sign up for a github account! Git is an awesome technology that allows you to save and share your progress as you write code, colloborate with other developers on a project, and organize your progress on a project. Github is the online platform we will use to interact with Git. 

If you want to learn a bit more about git, try this free online course: https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git

Once you've completed it -- share it with your future classmates! Post in your Learn class slack channel that you completed the git challenge. 


### 2. Start With the Basics

We want to use your time in class as efficiently as possible, so we expect that you know the basics of HTML and CSS when you start the class. To get ramped up on these two essential web technologies quickly, sign up for a codecademy account and try some of the HTML classes, they are short, fun, and a great way to prepare for the class.

Some of you might be thinking, "there's so much out there, how much do I need to know?" - and that's a great question. Here is a general list of HTML and CSS topics to know:
